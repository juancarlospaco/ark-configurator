# FAQ

- Why not Mobile App?.

Ark has so many configurations that you will be a year just scrolling thru the configurations on a tiny screen.

- Why not Web App?.

Web App looks cool, but you can not use Git to track changes on your configurations.

With this you can upload your configurations to GitHub or GitLab,
use Git branches to maintain parallel configurations updated,
quickly switch configurations using a different branch,
event-only configurations like Xmas special configurations,
or weekends-only configurations.

Use your favorite text editor or programming IDE to update the configurations.
Atom, VS Code, Notepad++ is still better than an HTML `<textarea>`.

Besides if you play Ark you already have a PC ;P
